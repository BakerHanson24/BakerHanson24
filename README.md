Hey there!  I'm Baker Hanson and I'm pursuing a lifelong career in Data Science.

Looking to utilize my advanced skills in SQL and R, and continue to learn new programming languages and evolving Data Science best practices for the rest of my career.

Am of an "old school" mentality, if possible: desire to stay with one organization for the remainder of my career.

Desire to deep-dive into the inner-workings of Business, to use my Servant Leadership mentality to bring people together from all corners of an organization.

Want to be part of an organization...
 - That champions continued learning of Data Science and Programming
 - Where creative problem-solving, trust, and freedom to try new methods are encouraged
 - That has a reputation for longevity, consistency (low turn-over)
 - Where the Cause and Vision is clearly defined and is unifying (Cause comes before Community)

Rigorous study of Data Science began in September 2020 and will never stop.

Lifelong student who plays with Data and studies advanced Statistics as a hobby.

Mega-nerd who uses SQL and R to analyze Major League Baseball data.

Locations: Whatcom or Skagit County, Washington. Open to Remote work.
